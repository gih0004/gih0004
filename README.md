### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Guillian HernÃ¡ndez, a graduate student in Virginia Tech. 
The purpose of this account is to share tools from both my research and personal projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Potato physiology research, with a strong focus on trascriptomics.
Additionaly, I will start to add repositories in this account from projects I have done for personal interest.

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small bioinformatics projects that may be related to the ones posted on this account. 
Mainly, intersted in helping others develop computational tools they can use for research.
